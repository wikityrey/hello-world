# hello-world

:angry:I have taken interest in learning Git and GitHub and this repository shall document my progress starting April 28, 2020. This is a good day as any, as I have been putting off this project for a long time. One factor that enable me to do this now is the ongoing Enhanced Community Quarantine (lockdown) due to Covid-19. As I write this down, I was stranded in the province of Aklan for more than a month now and since there is nothing else to do, this would be the best time to start this.

## Tasks

- [x] install command line tools: *__xcode-select --install__*

There is a wiki capability for documentation. It will be interesting to learn how to use it.
